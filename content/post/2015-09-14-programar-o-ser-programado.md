title: Â¿Programar o ser programado?
---

1. Rushkoff argues that as society and media has evolved, the general population was always one generation behind the elite group. We listened while the elite read to us. We read while the elite wrote. We wrote (blogged) while the elite coded. What is the next generation (i.e. when we all gain the ability to code, what will the elite be doing)?
2. Should our governments mandate that everyone learn to code, as part of a basic education everyone receives? Why or why not?
3. What are the social / cultural / economic / etc. reasons that prevent everyone from learning to code? (e.g. Cost of ownership of a computer? Language issues? Social pressures? etc.) What can educators around the world do to address them?
